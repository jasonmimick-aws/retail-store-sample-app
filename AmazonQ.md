# Amazon Q Chat Session - Retail Store Sample App

## Initial Question: Finding Image Files

**Human**: Hi Q - where are the image files for this project? The context is that we'd like to change the content of the demonstration retail app.

**Amazon Q**: I found several image files in the project. Here's where they're located:

1. Documentation images:
   - `./docs/images/` - Contains images used in documentation like architecture diagrams, screenshots, and banner images

2. Product images:
   - `./src/ui/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/products/` - These are the actual product images displayed in the retail store app
   - There are also copies of these same product images in `./samples/images/`

3. UI assets:
   - `./src/ui/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/` - Contains other UI images like:
     - hero.png (likely the homepage banner)
     - chat-avatar.png
     - order.png

## Understanding How Product Images Are Used

**Human**: How are the images in ./src/ui/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/products/ used in the application? How are they referenced and deployed?

**Amazon Q**: Now I understand how the product images are used in the application. Here's a comprehensive explanation:

### How Product Images are Referenced

1. **File Naming Convention**: 
   - Product images are stored as PNG files in `./src/ui/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/products/`
   - Each image is named with a UUID format (e.g., `1ca35e86-4b4c-4124-b6b5-076ba4134d0d.png`)
   - These UUIDs correspond to product IDs in the application

2. **HTML Templates**:
   - In `product_card.html` (used for catalog listings), images are referenced with:
     ```html
     th:src="@{/assets/img/products/{itemId}.png(itemId=${item.id})}"
     ```
   - In `detail.html` (product detail page), the same pattern is used:
     ```html
     th:src="@{/assets/img/products/{itemId}.png(itemId=${item.id})}"
     ```

3. **Thymeleaf Template Engine**:
   - The application uses Thymeleaf (a Java template engine) to dynamically insert the product ID into the image path
   - The `th:src` attribute replaces the standard `src` attribute at runtime
   - The `{itemId}` placeholder is filled with the product's ID from the model

### How Images are Deployed

1. **Static Resources**:
   - The images are stored in the `static` folder of the Spring Boot application
   - In Spring Boot, anything in `src/main/resources/static` is automatically served as static content
   - These files are packaged into the application JAR/WAR during the build process

2. **Serving Process**:
   - When the application is deployed (via Docker or other means), these static resources are included
   - Spring Boot's embedded web server serves these files directly when requested
   - No special controller is needed for static resources - Spring handles this automatically

3. **Controller Flow**:
   - The `CatalogController.java` handles requests to `/catalog` and `/catalog/{id}`
   - It loads product data from the catalog service and adds it to the model
   - The templates then use this data to construct the correct image URLs

### To Change Product Images

If you want to change the content of the demonstration retail app:

1. You would need to replace the PNG files in `./src/ui/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/products/` with your own images
2. Make sure to:
   - Keep the same filenames (UUIDs) to match the product IDs in the database
   - Use PNG format
   - Maintain similar dimensions for consistent UI appearance

The images are directly referenced by their product IDs, so as long as you maintain the same naming convention, the application will automatically use your new images when deployed.

## Creating Documentation

**Human**: Ok - could you please create a .md file with those steps - called something like "How to change the products" and then add the file into this repository?

**Amazon Q**: I've created a comprehensive Markdown file with instructions on how to change the product images in the retail store sample app. The file is now saved at:

`/Users/mimjasov/work/Datadog/retail-store-sample-app/docs/how-to-change-products.md`

The document includes:

1. An explanation of how product images work in the application
2. Details on image location and naming conventions
3. How images are referenced in the Thymeleaf templates
4. The deployment process for static resources
5. Step-by-step instructions for changing product images
6. Important notes and considerations
7. A list of the current product IDs used in the application

This documentation should help anyone who wants to customize the product images in the retail store demo application.

**Human**: Great thanks - can you also please create an md file with all the contents of this chat, and then add it to the current repository?

**Amazon Q**: I'll create a Markdown file with the contents of our chat and add it to the repository.

## Setting up Datadog Monitoring for ECS Deployment

**Human**: Hi - for this project - how do I setup the Datadog secret through terraform for the ECS deployment?

**Amazon Q**: Based on my analysis of your Terraform configuration, I can see that there's already a Datadog module set up in your project. Here's how to enable and configure the Datadog secret for your ECS deployment:

1. The Datadog integration is already implemented in your Terraform code, but it's disabled by default (the `enable_datadog` variable is set to `false`).

2. To enable Datadog and set up the secret, you need to create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following content:
   ```
   enable_datadog = true
   datadog_api_key = "YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY"
   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY` with your actual Datadog API key.

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

Here's how the Datadog integration works in your setup:

1. When `enable_datadog` is set to `true`, the Datadog module is activated.
2. The module creates an AWS Secrets Manager secret containing your Datadog API key.
3. The secret's ARN is passed to the ECS module, which can then use it to configure the Datadog agent in your ECS tasks.

The Datadog module handles:
- Creating a secret in AWS Secrets Manager for your Datadog API key
- Outputting the ARN of this secret, which is then used by the ECS module

This approach is secure because:
- The API key is stored as a sensitive value in Terraform
- The key is stored in AWS Secrets Manager rather than directly in task definitions
- The ECS tasks can access the secret at runtime without exposing the key in configuration files

**Human**: Yes - do we need a DATADOG_APP_KEY or any other DATADOG variables?

**Amazon Q**: Based on my analysis of your Terraform code, specifically the Datadog integration in your ECS deployment, I can confirm that:

1. You only need the `DATADOG_API_KEY` for the basic integration. The `APP_KEY` is not required for the current setup.

Looking at the `datadog-sidecar.tf` file, I can see that the Datadog agent is configured with:

- Only the `DD_API_KEY` secret, which is passed from the AWS Secrets Manager
- No reference to `DD_APP_KEY` or other Datadog authentication variables

The current configuration includes these Datadog-related settings:

1. **Agent Configuration**:
   - APM (Application Performance Monitoring) is enabled
   - Log collection is enabled for all containers
   - Process monitoring is enabled
   - Docker labels are mapped to Datadog tags
   - Environment tags are set based on your environment name and service name

2. **Application Container Configuration**:
   - Sets up the necessary environment variables for your application containers to connect to the Datadog agent
   - Enables log injection
   - Enables profiling
   - Sets service name and environment tags

This is a standard configuration for monitoring ECS services with Datadog. The API key is sufficient for:
- Metrics collection
- Log collection
- APM/tracing
- Process monitoring

The APP_KEY is typically only needed for:
- Making API calls to Datadog (like creating dashboards or monitors programmatically)
- Certain integrations that need to read data from Datadog

Since your setup is focused on sending telemetry data to Datadog rather than reading from or configuring Datadog, the API key alone is sufficient.

**Human**: Let's also check if there are any git changes.

**Amazon Q**: I see that the `terraform.tfvars` file we created is currently being ignored by git. This is actually good practice since it contains sensitive information (your Datadog API key).

Here's what I found in the git status:

1. Your repository is on the `main` branch and is up to date with the remote.

2. There are no tracked changes in your working directory.

3. There are several ignored files (which is normal for Terraform):
   - `terraform.tfstate`
   - `terraform/ecs/default/.terraform.lock.hcl`
   - `terraform/ecs/default/.terraform/` (directory)
   - `terraform/ecs/default/terraform.tfstate`
   - `terraform/ecs/default/terraform.tfstate.backup`
   - `terraform/ecs/default/terraform.tfvars` (the file we created)

The `terraform.tfvars` file is correctly being ignored by git, which is the recommended practice for files containing sensitive information like API keys. This prevents accidentally committing secrets to your repository.

**Human**: Ok - then please also make sure the datadog .md file in the docs folder has these instructions.

**Amazon Q**: I've made the following changes to help you set up Datadog monitoring for your ECS deployment:

1. Created a `terraform.tfvars.example` file in the `terraform/ecs/default` directory with:
   - Example configuration for enabling Datadog
   - Placeholder for your Datadog API key
   - Comments explaining other optional configuration options

2. Updated the `docs/enable-datadog.md` file with:
   - A new "Quick Start" section at the beginning for easy setup
   - Improved "Usage" section with two options:
     - Using terraform.tfvars (recommended approach)
     - Using command line variables (with a warning about shell history)
   - A note about the example file and security considerations

The changes confirm that:
1. You only need the Datadog API key for the basic integration (no APP_KEY required)
2. The terraform.tfvars file should not be committed to git (it's already in .gitignore)
3. The example file provides a template for users to create their own terraform.tfvars

**Human**: Let's commit and push these changes to git.

**Amazon Q**: Great! I've successfully committed and pushed the changes to your git repository. Here's what was done:

1. Added the modified files to the staging area:
   - `docs/enable-datadog.md` (updated documentation)
   - `terraform/ecs/default/terraform.tfvars.example` (new example file)

2. Committed the changes with the message:
   "Add Datadog setup documentation and example configuration"

3. Pushed the changes to the remote repository:
   - The changes were pushed to the main branch
   - The commit hash is 6991be0

The commit includes:
- Updated Datadog documentation with clear setup instructions
- An example terraform.tfvars file that users can use as a template
- Instructions on how to securely manage the Datadog API key

These changes will make it easier for users to enable Datadog monitoring in the retail store sample application while following security best practices for managing API keys.
